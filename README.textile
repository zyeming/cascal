h1. Simple Scala based Cassandra client

Cascal fork with support for TTL, Secondary indexes, Composite Columns & Counters Columns

h2. Description:

Cascal is a simple "Cassandra":http://cassandra.apache.org/ library built on the "Scala":www.scala-lang.org language that provides a very consistent and simple means by which you can interact with the Cassandra DB, providing simple means to:

* Insert / List / Get / Delete
* Batch Insert / Delete / Add
* Map Seq[Columns] Into Domain Objects
* Set Column TTL
* Secondary Indexes
* Counters Columns
* Experimental Static Composite Columns
* Utilize a Session Pool

One of the goals of Cassandra is to make the Thrift library operate in a way more conducive with the Scala language. As such when using Cascal you only need to used the Cascal libraries.

Please see the "wiki pages":http://wiki.github.com/shorrockin/cascal/ for detailed usage information. Until I will update the wiki take a look at:
* Column TTL: "TestStandardInesrtAndList":https://github.com/Shimi/cascal/blob/master/src/test/scala/com/shorrockin/cascal/TestStandardInesrtAndList.scala last test
* Secondary index: "TestSecondaryIndex":https://github.com/Shimi/cascal/blob/master/src/test/scala/com/shorrockin/cascal/TestSecondaryIndex.scala
* Counters columns: "CounterCoulmnTest":https://github.com/Shimi/cascal/blob/master/src/test/scala/com/shorrockin/cascal/CounterCoulmnTest.scala
* Static Composite Columns: "CompositeTest":https://github.com/Shimi/cascal/blob/master/src/test/scala/com/shorrockin/cascal/CompositeTest.scala
